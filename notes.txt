from the results above, the pattern observed is that the insert function takes more time on large and extra-
large arrays, while it takes less time on the medium, small and tiny array. 

The append array takes even lesser time depending on the size of the array, the extra-large and large array
takes the most time and the medium, small and tiny array takes less and less time.

The notable difference in the two functions is that insert function takes lesser time on the medium, small and tiny
array than the append function, while the append function takes lesser time on the extralarge and large array than 
the insert function.

In my opinion, i would say the insert function is good for smaller arrays while the append function is good for large
arrays, but generally the append function scales better in that it takes less time overall on any type of array given,
be it extra large, large, medium, small, or tiny.

The insert function is slower because its using unshift() and under the hood its having to insert the value and also
having to reassign a new index to all the values in the array.
